# Introduction to Kary Comments

## Fundamentals

Code is a piece of writing; mostly in a textual language and therefore like any other writing it is important to introduce the fundamentals of layouts into code for better management, beauty and ergonomics.

### Negative Space

Have you ever noticed how much a good book has empty white spaces? That is called a **negative space**. It is proven that mind cannot process too much and when provided with a figure, picture, or a hard sentence that requires focus it is needed to have white space margins surrounding that content to provide a more relaxed space for the mind to breath. Even this very article has a lots of negative space in it.

Code is a heavily complex subject. Most of the times codes are harder than math since the reader has to have thousands of lines of code in their mind to be able to read a new part of a complex system. Yet coders do not use white space enough, you can see that over the years tab is reduced from 4 spaces to 2. And if you think about negative space you realize programmers don't even bother. Kary Comments try to overcome this problem by forcing negative space into code.

### Eye Flow

Eye flow is the art of directing the reader's eye to see objects in order. By manipulating the size, color, position and weight of an object you make it pop out more and therefore be seen faster.

In code, unfortunately we use monospaced fonts and this enforces the same weight across the whole syntax which makes it having eye flow harder. Kary Comments establishes weights in form of ASCII art and therefore makes it possible to have hierarchy, focus point and right eye flow within code. 

### Layout

Have you ever tried to jump in novel? The hard part is that you have to start reading till realizing you were two page ahead. That is because novels come without any layout. The task of a layout system is to establish a foundation for jumping. You can always jump in a magazine from an article to another because they always have such great layouts.

I have realized that syntax highlighting also tries to establish the same goal, even if not realized by anyone in the industry. If you look at a code without highlights you see that you have to read it from start to end in order to realize it. While with highlights you can continuously jump around from one function to the other and instantly zoom in where you wanted to be. 

While code highlighting is awesome, it can only do so much. Have you ever got lost wondering what is closed by that `}` ?. Kary Comments help you draw visible and thick lines between the parts of your code and have them managed and organized. It's like comparing the layout of a text book to the layout of a great photography book. While the first one is great, the other is much more effective and easy to navigate.

## The Ideals In Action

Kary Comments are ways to separate parts of your code; create desirable negative space and establish eye flow but also decorate and beautify your codes. Kary Comments are the essential foundations of the Kary Coding Standard.

## How To Write These Comments?

As you can see writing these comments are really hard by hand and therefore a series of software are made to make it possible. These are some of these software:

* [Comment IV — In the browser](http://comment.kary.us/)
* [Kary Graph's Embedded Comment V](https://github.com/pmkary/graph)
* [Comment 3 — Native Mac OS X app](https://github.com/pmkary/comment-3)
