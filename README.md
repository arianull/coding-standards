# Kary's Coding Standards

## Why this coding style?

Code is something very pretty. It's a form af art and engineering. Yet, we write code that looks messy and horrible. I believe that codes must look nice and beautiful. When you read them they must show how careful they were written and how much love was put into writing them. Code must look like candy, art and engineering not creepy prices of characters stuck together.
