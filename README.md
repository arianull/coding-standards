# Overview

Code is something very pretty. It's a form af art and engineering. Yet, we write code that looks messy and horrible. I believe that codes must look nice and beautiful. When you read them they must show how careful they were written and how much love was put into writing them. Code must look like candy, art and engineering. This standard is one—in a [series of attempts](https://writings.kary.us/2017/05/16/my-journey-to-clean-code/)—to push the state of beauty in code. Hope you feel the candy inside...
